        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello and my name is Miguel Atanacio and I'm a 22 year old computer science major.
          I have been working with code for the past 7 years all throughout high school,
          college and even during my spare time. I currently reside in Paterson,NJ and enjoy hobbies like roller blading
          and spending time adventuring out to new places with my significant other.</p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>Here I am showcasing my top projects that I have made over the years 
          along with what programs I used in each project. Each project also will indicate 
          how long it took to get the finished product.
